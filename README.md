                                              **TACKLING THE CENTRALIZATION PROBLEM IN DAOs**

## iNTRODUCTION
DAOs are not without flaws, chief among them is the plutocratic problem - caused by the concentration of majority tokens in the hands of a small group of people who drive the collective decision-making of the whole community for better or worse.
This essay looks at the dimensions of this centralization problems within DAOs from different angles, broadly divides them into three:

1. *Users see governance token as yields, not voting tools;* in reality there is a stronger financial incentives behind using *gov* tokens as tools for earning yields, staking and lending. This means DAO members perceive a stronger value-case for using governance tokens as a means of earning passive income versus participating in the governance process. This individualistic approach to using *gov* tokens rubs eschews the principles of collaboration and group-oriented governance which is the true purpose of these tokens and DAOs. It also suggests that there may be a need to seriously decouple financial incentives from governance tokens as much possible.

2. *The quorum for voting focuses on tokens and not voters;* which means the voting outcome almost always tilts towards the choice of the majority token holders instead of the choice of the majority voters. This simulates a plutocratic system of governance where decisions are made by a small, rich group of majority token holders. The solution to this is to require a quorum of participating voters for a proposal to be passed instead of tokens.

3. *Private sale to investors and founders who invariably become major token holders;* this is a bit of a chicken and egg situation, because, without the private investment of investors and founders in the beginning, most DAOs wouldn't take off in the first place. Yet for DAOs to work the way they are supposed to work it's important for them to their divest their majority tokens at some point. The issue here is more ethical and it's probably a good way of judging how much founders and investors believe in decentralized governance for DAOs in the first place.


### The one major benefit of the centralization effect in DAOs...

*Faster decision making*; slow decision making is one of the major failings of decentralization, and the reason is because more people are required to deliberate and make a decision. This becomes a very grave condition in urgent situations where some proposals needs to voted on as soon as possible. This is where centralization within DAOs can be of good use. The core members of a DAO who often are the founders, investors, early adopters can form the central group of DAOs that can be called upon in situations of urgent priority. Making use of their high level of familiarity and experience with the DAO to make effectively benefical decisions. To make the access to the central group more democratic, new members can join via a reputation score system which evaluates their level of participation and immersion in DAO activities.

### All proposals are important but some are more important than each other..

*Urgent proposals* are proposals that need to be implemented as soon as possible. e.g: security threats. the key factor with urgent proposals is the time factor and speeding the decision making as fast as possible. 

*Important proposals* are proposals that need a bit more time to be evaluated and judged

*Weak proposals* are usually proposals of little consequence and can most of the can be weeded out by stipulating the staking of stipulated number of tokens to evaluate the level of commitment of the part of the proposer.

+ the proposer: the member(s) who submits a proposal for voting purposes.
+ quorum: the minimum number of voters required for a proposal to pass a stage.
+ core: the core members with high reputation scores
+ sponsors: the dao members who are in support of a proposal and contribute their resources into pushing it
+ members: the voting public

PROPOSAL  - One/more proposer(s) introduces a proposal to the DAO community. They back their proposal with a stipulated amount of tokens (e.g: 100T).

CAMPAIGN - The campaign stage involves them garnering community support for the proposal's cause. At this stage, at least 25% of the member community need to express their support for the proposal for it to pass through to the next stage. This preliminary vote of support can be done in social media channels like Discord.

REVIEW - The review stage involves the core members of the community whose job here is to filter and evaluate the utility of the proposal, their job here is to judge the usefulness of the proposal to the community based on their high level of experience and investment in the community. The review stage is a unique stage because here you need not just a percentage number of the core-members but you also need them to collaboratively stake a specific high number of their tokens to the proposal to show their trust in it. For example in a DAO community of 1000 members, the requirement for a proposal passing the review stage is at least 670 members in support + 10,000T. Here 67% of the core-membership has expressed their support of the proposal while also committing their governance tokens.

VOTE -  The public voting which can be done on the blockchain is open to the general members of the community once again, and here one member vote is equal to one vote, no matter how much governance token they hold. The proposal needs to win 75% of the voting public on the D-Day for it to be approved.

FINAL - This is when the proposal has been voted on and approved now it can be implemented on chain.

### Procedure for granting urgent proposals 

The procedure for granting *urgent* proposals seeks to cut down as many steps as possible involved in *important* proposals,
