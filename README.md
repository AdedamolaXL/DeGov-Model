# DE-GOV MODEL

## iNTRODUCTION
DAOs are not without flaws, chief among them is the plutocratic problem - caused by the concentration of majority tokens in the hands of a small group of people who drive the collective decision-making of the whole community for better or worse.
This essay looks at the dimensions of this centralization problems within DAOs from different angles and broadly divides them into three:

1. *Users see governance token as yields, not voting tools;* in reality the stronger financial incentives behind *gov* tokens for yields, staking and lending means DAO members perceive a stronger value-case for appropiating governance token for earning passive income versus participating in the governance process. This individualistic approach to using *gov* tokens rubs unfairly to collaboration and group-oriented governance which is the true purpose of these tokens and DAOs. It also suggests that there may be a need to seriously decouple financial incentives from governance tokens as much possible.

2. *The quorum for voting focuses on tokens and not voters;* which means the voting outcome tilts towards the majority token holders instead of majority voters. This simulates a plutocratic system of governance where decisions are made by a small, rich group of majority token holders. The solution to this is to require a quorum of 60% of participating voters for a proposal to be passed.

3. *Private sale to investors and founders who invariably become major token holders;* this is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Without the private investment from the investors and founders in the beginning, most DAOs would be unable to take off. Yet it's important for them to their divest their majority tokens at some point. The issue here is more ethical and it's probably a good way of judging the intentions of founders and early investors and their belief in decentralization.

4. *Voter apathy*; this is more of a social problem caused by lack of information or understanding of the power in using governance tokens. This requires high level politicking and vocal address from important members of the community who can spark passionate support from members of the community. Voters will always vote once they are passionate about a cause.

## THE ONE BENEFIT OF CENTRALIZATION IN DAOs

5. *Faster decision making*; contradictorily this can actually only be solved by centralization, this is because the more people are required to deliberate and make a decision, the longer it will take for it to be finalized. The obvious solution to this is to make urgent proposals pass through a more central group versus other important proposals. This central group can be the core DAO members with high reputation scores.

## Classifying proposals into *important proposals* and *urgent proposals* 

how do you define an important versus urgent proposal based on time, all proposals are important, but some are more important than each other, urgent proposals are proposals that need to be implemented as soon as possible. e.g: security threats. the key factor with urgent proposals is the time factor and speeding the decision making as fast as possible. stipulating token staking to encourage only important proposals.

+ the proposer: the member(s) who submits a proposal for voting purposes.
+ quorum: the minimum number of voters required for a proposal to pass a stage.
+ core: the core members with high reputation scores
+ sponsors: the dao members who are in support of a proposal and contribute their resources into pushing it
+ members: the voting public

## DESIGNING DeGov Models for different usecases..

### Important proposals - 


PROPOSAL  - One/more proposer(s) introduces a proposal to the DAO community. They back their proposal with a stipulated amount of tokens (e.g: 100T).

CAMPAIGN - The campaign stage involves politicking and generating vocal support for the proposal's cause. At this stage, the proposal needs the support of at least 25% of the member community to pass through to the next stage. Proof of this, is that 25% of the membership need to commit their own tokens as well (e.g 10T each), this may be returned later or not.

REVIEW - The review stage involves the core members of the community whose job here is to filter and evaluate the utility of the proposal, the pros and cons and judge how it will be of benefit to the community as a whole.

VOTE -  The public voting which can be done on the blockchain is open to the general members of the community once again, and here one member vote is equal to one vote, no matter how much governance token they hold.

FINAL - This is when the proposal has been voted on and approved now it can be implemented on chain.
STAGNANT 
WITHDRAWN - 

### Urgent proposals 

PROPOSAL - One/more proposer(s) introduces a proposal to the DAO community. They back their proposal with a stipulated amount of tokens (e.g: 100T).

REVIEW -  The review stage involves the core members of the community whose job here is to filter and evaluate the utility of the proposal, the pros and cons and judge how it will be of benefit to the community as a whole.

VOTE -  For urgent proposals, once it has passed the review stage, it can be immediately implemented.
